# Rules for SBCC

The Single Board Computer Competition (SBCC) has set the following rules to ensure fair and equal competition among participants. First, Apple M1-M4 chips are off-limits. Additionally, participants must use a minimum of 4 sockets and run MPI. The power limit is set at 250 watts, and the cost limit is $6,000 MSRP (American MSRP).

The competition will include benchmarking challenges, such as the High-Performance Linpack (HPL) and Sustainable Memory Bandwidth in High Performance Computers (STREAM) and Distributed-llama (D-Llama). There is a application challenge, which will be the Hashcat.

The SBCC competition will be held virtually, with the option for in-person participation. The event will take place on April 10-12th.

To measure efficiency, the GFLOPS/watt for the chips being tested will be recorded based on HPL results. A sample result of what is expected can be found here: https://github.com/deater/performance_results. We just want a table with the chips and their gflops/watt.

The SBCC competition presents a unique opportunity for participants to showcase their skills in building and optimizing single board computer clusters, while also gaining valuable knowledge and experience in the field of high-performance computing.
